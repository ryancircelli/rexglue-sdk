# Code ported from other ReXGlue projects

Some changes in this SDK were ported from patches that other ReXGlue
game ports carry against the SDK. Each commit names its source patch in
its message. The notices below are kept as those projects' licenses

## GTA V recomp

The MoltenVK defaults (`MVK_CONFIG_FAST_MATH_ENABLED=0`,
`MVK_CONFIG_SHOULD_MAXIMIZE_CONCURRENT_COMPILATION=1`) follow findings
documented by https://github.com/andrewnakas/gtav-recomp. No code was
copied from it, so no notice is needed.
